        Function to perform the mutation operator on a solution.

        Parameters:

            solution (Solution) - the solution we want to mutate.
            supervisors (dictionary) - dictionary of all supervisors with their details (id,preferences,quota)
            probability (float) - the probability of mutating an edge.
            swapProbability (float) - the probability of doing a swap on a mutating edge.
            transferProbability (float) - the probability of doing a transfer on a mutating edge.

        Returns:

            newSolutions (list) - list of mutated solutions. Same size as the given population.
